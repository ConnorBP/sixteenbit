# RLE Pixel Art Editor
A pixel art editor designed specifically for use with the indexed color RLE compression format I designed.

## Feature goals:

- [ ] decent pixel drawing tools
- [ ] built in conversion to my image compression formats and preview of size
- [ ] output image to clipboard as hex string
- [ ] import any image and snap its colors to the closest index value
- [ ] display image in multiple palettes
- [ ] Allow for import, edit, and export of custom palettes as json
- [ ] Add character component DNA builder and preview system
- [ ] Store and save past components in some sort of file format (json?)
